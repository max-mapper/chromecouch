# ChromeCouch
...is a thing that lives in Google Chrome (and someday Firefox) that detects couchapps as you browse around and lets you really easily replicate them to your couch!

This is experimental software! Install it here if you wanna test it out: [CouchDB Replicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clbdmcdmjlpgedncppkbkepbilnhgddh)
